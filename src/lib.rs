//! Event-Scanner is a library made to stream EVM event logs.
//!
//! The main entry point is [`EventScanner`], built via [`EventScannerBuilder`] in one of the
//! supported modes (e.g. [`Historic`] or [`Live`]).
//!
//! # Node compatibility
//!
//! Event Scanner's test suite and examples are exercised against Foundry's `anvil` dev node.
//!
//! While the library is intended to work with other EVM nodes and RPC providers, behaviour may
//! vary across implementations. If you encounter errors when using a different node/provider,
//! please report them at <https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/Event-Scanner/issues>.
//!
//! After constructing a scanner, register one or more event subscriptions with
//! [`EventScanner::subscribe`], then call [`EventScanner::start`] to begin streaming.
//!
//! # Stream items
//!
//! Each subscription yields an [`EventScannerResult`]. Successful items are [`Message`] values,
//! which wrap either event batches or a [`Notification`] (see [`ScannerMessage`]).
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! Ordering is preserved *per subscription stream*. There is no global ordering guarantee across
//! different subscriptions.
//!
//! # Reorgs and finality
//!
//! When scanning non-finalized blocks, the scanner may detect chain reorganizations and will emit
//! [`Notification::ReorgDetected`]. Consumers should assume the same events might be delivered more
//! than once around reorgs (i.e. benign duplicates are possible).
//!
//! [`BlockNumberOrTag::Finalized`][finalized] is treated as the authoritative finality boundary
//! when the scanner needs one. In live mode, `block_confirmations` delays emission to reduce the
//! chance that already-emitted blocks are affected by shallow reorganizations.
//!
//! # Dedupe vs rollback
//!
//! Event-Scanner does not include a built-in deduplication utility. Depending on your
//! application, you can:
//!
//! - **Implement idempotency/deduplication** (for example, keyed by transaction hash and log index,
//!   optionally including block hash).
//! - **Handle reorgs by rollback**: interpret [`Notification::ReorgDetected`] as a signal to revert
//!   application state for blocks after the reported common ancestor.
//!
//! # Backpressure and lag
//!
//! Streams are buffered. If a consumer cannot keep up and an internal broadcast receiver lags,
//! the subscription stream yields [`ScannerError::Lagged`].
//!
//! [finalized]: alloy::eips::BlockNumberOrTag::Finalized
